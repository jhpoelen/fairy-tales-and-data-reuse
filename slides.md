## Guiding Question

### How do *you* ensure your data is reused?  

## Digital Data are hard to reuse

> [...] In 2016, the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’^[Wilkinson, et al. 2016, Sci Data [doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)] were published in Scientific Data. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles **emphasise machine-actionability** (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the **increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data**. [...] ^[Accessed on 2025-11-19 at https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/.]

## **Biodiversity** Data are hard to reuse

> [...] “**The various books and journals of ornithology and entomology are like a row of beehives containing an immense amount of valuable honey, which has been stored up in separate cells by the bees that made it.** The advantage, and at the same time the difficulty, of ecological work is that it attempts to provide conceptions which can link up into some complete scheme the colossal store of facts about natural history which has accumulated up to date in this rather haphazard manner. [...] Until more organised information about the subject is available, it is only possible to give a few instances of some of the more clear­cut niches which happen to have been worked out. [...]” ^[Charles Elton, 1927. Animal Ecology. pp 65-66. [doi:10.5962/bhl.title.7435](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/7236467)]

## Is GBIF our FAIR Data Fairy?

GBIF Secretariat provides a publication **framework** for biodiversity data, but **is neither the owner nor custodian of such data**, and therefore is not responsible for the actual content served by Data Publishers.

GBIF Secretariat cannot guarantee the quality or completeness of data, **nor does it guarantee uninterrupted data access services**. Users employ these data and services at their own risk. ^[https://www.gbif.org/terms/data-user as accessed on 2025-10-13].

### No! 

### **GBIF provides a framework in which standardized biodiversity datasets can be registered, reviewed, and queried. However, you are responsible for ensuring that the data continues to be fit for reuse.**

## Recent Reminders of FAIR Data Fairy Absence

Scholarly data...

 * cannot be found because it is left unpublished on a personal laptop or desk drawer 
 * cannot be accessed due to "data available on request" of retired/deceased author
 * is lost due to malicious activity (e.g., hacking, ransonware) or human error (oops!)
 * is published using custom schemas instead of schemas used by others
 * is published in proprietary or machine unfriendly file formats (e.g., xlsx, docx, pdf)
 * is riddled with data inconsistencies and typos
 * cannot be easily reused/linked/integrated with other datasets/projects
 * are effectively excluded during peer review process due to time constraints

## Guiding Questions

### How do *you* reuse/review your own (past, present, future) digital research data? 

### How do *you* reuse/review third party (past, present, future) digital research data?

## Peer Review for Digital Biodiversity Data 
 
 * What is so neat about peer review? 

 * How to review digital data?

## The Neat Thing about Peer Review

~~Even before~~ Mainly after the invention of the book press, ~~books and scrolls~~ **scholarly journals and academic societies**^[First journal "Philosophical Transactions" was launched in 1665 according to https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstl accessed on 2025-11-19.] have been pretty successful in transferring **scientific** knowledge across generations and around the world. 

~~Books~~ **Scholarly journals** are kept around the world in (little) public libraries, academic institutions, private collections and national archives.

~~Books~~ **Printed scholarly journals** are wireless, their content cannot be easily altered remotely, changes can be detected (ripped out pages), and they need no power to operate. (note to self: archive digital only journals)

Typically, scholarly journals employ a peer review process to select scholarly works of interest and increase their quality through review cycles and discourse.

### Idea ...  what if we treat digital data more like a peer-reviewed publication instead of some haphazardly organized data appendix?

## Steps to Reviewing Digital Data

To enable the discovery of existing species interaction datasets, Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) continuously tracks existing datasets and integrates the discovered interaction records. These integrated interaction records form the basis of the GloBI’s interpreted interaction data. ^[https://globalbioticinteractions.org/process accessed on 2025-11-19]

Step 1. _automatically_ discover species interaction datasets

Step 2. _automatically_ *access* up-to-date datasets and versioned them

Step 3. _automatically_ *parse* data and link/integrate with other datasets (e.g., taxonomic resources) 

Step 4. _automatically_ *produce* derived data products and data services

Step 5. _automatically_ *publish* derived datasets and associated GloBI data reviews

Step 6. _semi-manual_ solicit feedback and encourage discussion through open access and 

Step 7. repeat continuously until (not yet planned) retirement

## Steps to Reviewing Digital Data: Example

Step 1. use Elton ^[For review robots description see: https://globalbioticinteractions.org/process] to discover dataset metadata at https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/light2019 

Step 2. use Elton to access and version csv file available through [Google Sheet 1Fo...DxY](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1FoGhyDoPlPa7FHyUZO8VEvLdLkoJB84H2f7sgXPFDxY/export?format=csv) 

Step 3. use Elton and Nomer to align taxonomic names with NCBI taxonomy, Catalogue of Life etc.

Step 4. use Elton, Nomer, pandoc to produce derived datasets and a data review. 

Step 5. use Preston to *publish* derived datasets and associated GloBI data review to Zenodo.

Step 6. _semi-manual_ solicit feedback and encourage discussion through email, meetings and open data platforms

Step 7. repeat continuously until (not yet planned) retirement
