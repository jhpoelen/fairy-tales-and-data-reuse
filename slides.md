## Guiding Question

### How do *you* ensure your data is reused?  

## Digital Data are hard to reuse

> [...] In 2016, the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’^[Wilkinson, et al. 2016, Sci Data [doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)] were published in Scientific Data. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles **emphasise machine-actionability** (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the **increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data**. [...] ^[Accessed on 2025-11-19 at https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/.]

## **Biodiversity** Data are hard to reuse

> [...] “**The various books and journals of ornithology and entomology are like a row of beehives containing an immense amount of valuable honey, which has been stored up in separate cells by the bees that made it.** The advantage, and at the same time the difficulty, of ecological work is that it attempts to provide conceptions which can link up into some complete scheme the colossal store of facts about natural history which has accumulated up to date in this rather haphazard manner. [...] Until more organised information about the subject is available, it is only possible to give a few instances of some of the more clear­cut niches which happen to have been worked out. [...]” ^[Charles Elton, 1927. Animal Ecology. pp 65-66. [doi:10.5962/bhl.title.7435](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/7236467)]

## Is GBIF our FAIR Data Fairy?

GBIF Secretariat provides a publication **framework** for biodiversity data, but **is neither the owner nor custodian of such data**, and therefore is not responsible for the actual content served by Data Publishers.

GBIF Secretariat cannot guarantee the quality or completeness of data, **nor does it guarantee uninterrupted data access services**. Users employ these data and services at their own risk. ^[https://www.gbif.org/terms/data-user as accessed on 2025-10-13].

### No! 

### **GBIF provides a framework in which standardized biodiversity datasets can be registered, reviewed, and queried. However, you are responsible for ensuring that the data continues to be fit for reuse.**

## Recent Reminders of FAIR Data Fairy Absence

 * Despite a massive digitization effort, massive amounts of valuable knowledge remains jailed in pdfs or other hard-to-reuse data formats. Plazi is an effort to open up access to structured biodiversity data knowledge.
 * Despite the rise of data publication mechanisms through data appendices and dedicated peer-reviewed data journals, digital data remains hard to reuse. 
 * Despite the increase support and adoption of open access and FAIR principles, ...].  
 * difficulties in Name alignment taxonomic name integration 
 * alignment of date / geolocation with readily available  
 * reuse of readily available datasets through 
 * resolving of provenance reference citation 
 * difficulties of sharing specific versions of datasets
 * difficulties of gathering constructive feedback in diverse/cross-displinary research communities

## Peer Review for Digital Biodiversity Data 
 
 * What is so neat about peer review? 

 * How to review digital data?

## The Neat Thing about Peer Review

~~Even before~~ Mainly after the invention of the book press, ~~books and scrolls~~ **scholarly journals and academic societies**^[First journal "Philosophical Transactions" was launched in 1665 according to https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstl accessed on 2025-11-19.] have been pretty successful in transferring **scientific** knowledge across generations and around the world. 

~~Books~~ **Scholarly journals** are kept around the world in (little) public libraries, academic institutions, private collections and national archives.

~~Books~~ **Printed scholarly journals** are wireless, their content cannot be easily altered remotely, changes can be detected (ripped out pages), and they need no power to operate. (note to self: archive digital only journals)

Typically, scholarly journals employ a peer review process to select scholarly works of interest and increase their quality through review cycles and discourse.

### Idea ...  what if we treat digital data more like a peer-reviewed publication instead of some haphazardly organized data appendix?

## Steps to Reviewing Digital Data

Step 1. Update and share your data early and often, ideally using *versioned* copies of digital data referenced by **signed** citations ^[Elliott et al. 2023. Sci Data. [doi:10.1038/s41597-023-02230-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02230-y)].

Step 2. Ask friends and family (e.g., close collaborators) to review/reuse a specific version of your data. Repeat step 1.

Step 3. Ask consortium members to review/reuse a specific version of your data. Repeat steps 1-2.

Step 4. Ask external members to review and *reuse* early versions of your data. Repeat steps 1-3. 

Step 5. Register your data with data registries/journals, track reuse and gather (automated?) feedback. Repeat steps 1-5. 

Step 6. Register your data with data journals and gather to review and *reuse* early versions of your data. Repeat steps 1-3. 

Step 7. Repeat steps 1-6 until you retire your data.
