ensure your data is reused?</h3>
<h2 id="digital-data-are-hard-to-reuse">Digital Data are hard to
reuse</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] In 2016, the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data
management and stewardship’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> were published in
Scientific Data. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve
the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital
assets. The principles <strong>emphasise machine-actionability</strong>
(i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access,
interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention)
because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with
data as a result of the <strong>increase in volume, complexity, and
creation speed of data</strong>. […] <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"

<h2
id="biodiversity-data-are-hard-to-reuse"><strong>Biodiversity</strong>
Data are hard to reuse</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] “<strong>The various books and journals of ornithology and
entomology are like a row of beehives containing an immense amount of
valuable honey, which has been stored up in separate cells by the bees
that made it.</strong> The advantage, and at the same time the
difficulty, of ecological work is that it attempts to provide
conceptions which can link up into some complete scheme the colossal
store of facts about natural history which has accumulated up to date in
this rather haphazard manner. […] Until more organised information about
the subject is available, it is only possible to give a few instances of
some of the more clear­cut niches which happen to have been worked out.

https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/light2019</p>
<p>Step 2. use Elton to access and version csv file available through <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1FoGhyDoPlPa7FHyUZO8VEvLdLkoJB84H2f7sgXPFDxY/export?format=csv">Google
Sheet 1Fo…DxY</a></p>
<p>Step 3. use Elton and Nomer to align taxonomic names with NCBI
taxonomy, Catalogue of Life etc.</p>
<p>Step 4. use Elton, Nomer, pandoc to produce derived datasets and a
data review.</p>
<p>Step 5. use Preston to <em>publish</em> derived datasets and
associated GloBI data review to Zenodo.</p>
<p>Step 6. <em>semi-manual</em> solicit feedback and encourage
discussion through email, meetings and open data platforms</p>
<p>Step 7. repeat continuously until (not yet planned) retirement</p>
